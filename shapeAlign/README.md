#shapeAlign
shapeAlign is a C++ implementation of an approach for sequence-agnostic alignment of DNA shape matrices.

[`shape_alignment_method.pdf`](shape_alignment_method.pdf) contains an outline of how the shape alignment approach works.

`test/` contains a Perl script for generating simulated data for alignment.
