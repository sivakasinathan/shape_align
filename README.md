# shape_align
Sequence-independent alignment of DNA shape profiles at transcription factor (TF) binding sites identified using chromatin endogenous cleavage and sequencing (ChEC-seq).

[`shapeAlign`](https://github.com/sivakasinathan/shape_align/tree/master/shapeAlign) contains C++ source code implementing a sequence-independent approach for alignment of DNA shape profiles and a detailed description of the algorithm.

[`other`](https://github.com/sivakasinathan/shape_align/tree/master/shapeAlign/other) contains raw data and outputs of analysis.
