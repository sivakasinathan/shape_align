# FASTA files used for shape alignment

Sequences are centered on peak midpoints; sequence names contain midpoint and Fast/Slow designation where appropriate. Other data in sequence names are taken from the Supp. Table of Zentner, et al. Nat Comm 2015.

Shape features were generated from FASTA files using [DNAshapeR](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26668005) from the Rohs group.
